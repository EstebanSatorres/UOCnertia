# UOCnertia
This is one of the assignments from OOP I had to complete to pass the module. It consists on a two-dimensional game called UOCnertia whose objective
is to collect all the gems on the board without falling on a mined square. The fun of the game is that the player (when he/she starts to move) does 
not stop until he/she either hits a wall, or passes over a stop square, or hits the side of the board, or passes over a mine. 

This version of the game is inspired by the game Inertia by Ben Olmstead.
